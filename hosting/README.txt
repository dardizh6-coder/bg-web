Upload this folder's CONTENTS to your web host:

- index.html
- static/
  - app.css
  - app.js
  - logo.png

Important:
- If you only upload index.html, you'll get NO CSS. You must upload the static/ folder too.
- The app needs backend API routes (/api/*). If your host is "static only", the UI will load but uploads/background removal will NOT work.
